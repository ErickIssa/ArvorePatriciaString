the old stood at the heart of the abandoned village its rusted gears frozen in time its face cracked and bleached by decades of relentless sun and unrelenting rain no one remembered who had built it nor why the villagers had left so suddenly leaving behind empty houses with doors still slightly ajar as if their occupants had merely stepped out for a moment and never returned the wind whispered through the broken windows carrying fragments of forgotten conversations and the floorboards creaked underfoot groaning like the ghosts of those who had once walked there children from nearby towns dared each other to approach the tower at midnight claiming that the clocks hands would move on their own counting down to some unseen catastrophe but no one ever stayed long enough to see if it was true except for me i had always been drawn to the eerie silence of the place the way the air thickened with the weight of untold stories and on that final evening as the last rays of sunlight bled from the sky i placed my hand against the cold stone and swore i heard the faintest tick tick tick from within as if the tower had been waiting all these years for someone to listen waiting within heart
